<InnerNavigation />

<!-- Overview Content Start -->
<p class="overview">Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest 
to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the 
shortest of all the Sun's planets. Mercury is one of four terrestrial 
planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like Earth.</p>

<!-- Overview Content End -->

<!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->
<p class="internal-structure">Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a 
solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and 
a solid inner core. The planet's density is the second highest in the 
Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3 , only slightly less than Earth's density.</p>

<!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->
<p>Mercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing 
extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering, indicating that it has 
been geologically inactive for billions of years. It is more heterogeneous 
than either Mars's or the Moon’s.</p>
