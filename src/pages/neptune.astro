  <!-- Overview Content Start -->
  <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar 
  System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, 
  and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, more massive than 
  its near-twin Uranus.</p>

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->
  <p>Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% 
  to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core. 
  Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions.</p>

  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->
  <p>Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium. A trace amount of methane is also 
  present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in 
  the red and infrared portion of the spectrum.</p>
